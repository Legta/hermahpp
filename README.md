This is my simple chat project meant for learning and personal use.

For now this is just a prototype to see how things may work and to practice so this project is likely going to be remade from scratch on a different repo with possibly different tools, such as React, and also with more refining to each and every part of the code.

Uses Firebase for authentication and as the database for messages

Dev dependencies:
npm 10.3.0
